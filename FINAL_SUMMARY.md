3. **✅ Duplicate Imports**
   - Location: `ML_based_detectionn/app.py` (lines 77-82)
   - Impact: Code redundancy and potential namespace issues
   - Fix: Removed duplicate import statements

4. **✅ Poor Model Loading Error Handling**
   - Location: `ML_based_detectionn/app.py`
   - Impact: Application would crash if model file missing
   - Fix: Graceful degradation - app starts with warning, provides user feedback

5. **✅ No Model Validation During Prediction**
   - Location: `ML_based_detectionn/app.py`
   - Impact: Application would crash when analyzing files without model
   - Fix: Added model validation and user-friendly error messages

6. **✅ HTML Syntax Error**
   - Location: `ML_based_detectionn/templates/index.html` (line 7)
   - Impact: Invalid HTML (missing closing tag)
   - Fix: Changed `/title>` to `</title>`
