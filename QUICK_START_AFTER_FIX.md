## 🚀 How to Start Using Now

### Option 1: Start ML Detection App

```bash
cd ML_based_detectionn
python3 app.py
```

Then open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Option 2: Start Threat Intelligence App

```bash
cd Virus_total_based
python3 app.py
```

Then open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5001
```

### Option 3: Use Production Scripts

```bash
# For ML Detection
./start_ml_app.sh

# For Threat Intelligence
./start_virustotal_app.sh
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**The Problem:**
- Routes only accepted POST requests
- Browser refreshes, back button, or direct URL access caused HTTP 405 errors

**The Solution:**
- All `/analyze` routes now accept both GET and POST methods
- GET requests are gracefully redirected to the home page
- User-friendly messages are displayed
- No more 405 errors!

4. **Click "Analyze"** button
5. ✅ **It works!** No more HTTP 405 error!

### Additional Tests:
