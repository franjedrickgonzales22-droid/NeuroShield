# ‚úÖ .txt File Support Added

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Developer:** F.J.G

---

## üéØ What's New

**.txt files are now accepted!**

You can now upload and analyze:
- ‚úÖ `.exe` files (executable files) - ML analysis
- ‚úÖ `.dll` files (dynamic libraries) - ML analysis  
- ‚úÖ `.txt` files (text files) - **NEW!** Keyword analysis

---

## üîç How .txt Files Are Analyzed

### Different Analysis Method

Since the ML model is trained on **PE (Portable Executable) file features**, text files use a **different analysis method**:

**For .exe and .dll files:**
- Uses machine learning model
- Extracts 23 PE file features
- 91% accuracy malware detection

**For .txt files:**
- Uses keyword-based heuristic analysis
- Scans for suspicious keywords
- Simple but effective detection

---

## üîë Suspicious Keywords Detected

The system checks for these keywords in text files:
- `malware`
- `virus`
- `exploit`
- `payload`
- `shell`
- `backdoor`
- `ransomware`
- `trojan`
- `rootkit`
- `keylogger`
- `botnet`

**Classification:**
- **Safe:** 0-2 suspicious keywords found
- **Suspicious:** 3+ suspicious keywords found

---

## üìä Example Results

### Safe Text File:
```
File: document.txt
Classification: Safe
Confidence: 90%
Note: Text file analysis - basic keyword detection
```

### Suspicious Text File:
```
File: malicious_script.txt
Classification: Suspicious
Confidence: 60%
Note: Text file analysis - basic keyword detection
```

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Go to:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

2. **Upload any of these file types:**
   - .exe files
   - .dll files
   - .txt files ‚Üê **NEW!**

3. **Click "Analyze"**

4. **Get results:**
   - Classification (Safe/Malware/Suspicious)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Analysis type

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Text File Analysis Process:

1. **File Upload:** .txt file is uploaded
2. **Save:** File saved temporarily
3. **Read:** First 10KB of content read
4. **Scan:** Content scanned for suspicious keywords
5. **Classify:** Based on number of keywords found
6. **Result:** Classification returned
7. **Cleanup:** File automatically deleted

### Size Limits:

- **All files:** 10 MB maximum
- **Text analysis:** Reads first 10 KB only

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

1. **Limited Read:** Only first 10KB analyzed
2. **Safe Encoding:** Uses UTF-8 with error handling
3. **No Execution:** Text files are never executed
4. **Automatic Cleanup:** Files deleted after analysis
5. **Sanitized Names:** Filename sanitization prevents attacks

## üìù Supported File Types Summary

| File Type | Extension | Analysis Method | Accuracy |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Executables | .exe | ML Model (23 features) | 91% |
| Libraries | .dll | ML Model (23 features) | 91% |
| Text Files | .txt | Keyword Heuristics | Basic |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Text File Analysis Limitations:

1. **Not ML-based:** Uses simple keyword matching
2. **Basic detection:** May miss sophisticated threats
3. **False positives:** Technical documents might trigger keywords
4. **Heuristic only:** Not as accurate as ML analysis

### Recommendations:

- **For executables:** Use .exe/.dll analysis (91% ML accuracy)
- **For text files:** Results are basic indicators only
- **For scripts:** Consider using specialized analysis tools

---

## ‚úÖ What Changed

### Code Changes:

1. **Added .txt to allowed extensions:**
   ```python
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'exe', 'dll', 'txt'}
   ```

2. **Added text file handler:**
   - Reads file content safely
   - Scans for suspicious keywords
   - Returns classification

3. **Updated error messages:**
   - Now mentions .txt files are supported

4. **Different analysis paths:**
   - .exe/.dll ‚Üí ML model
   - .txt ‚Üí Keyword analysis

## üß™ Test It

I created a test file for you: `/workspace/test_sample.txt`

**Try it:**
1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
2. Upload `/workspace/test_sample.txt`
3. Click "Analyze"
4. Should return: "Safe" (no suspicious keywords)
