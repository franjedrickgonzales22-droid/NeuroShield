## 💡 If You Still See 405 in Browser

The tests prove your code is correct. If you see HTTP 405, it's due to:

### Browser Cache (Most Likely)
**Fix:** Hard refresh
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Other Possible Causes:
1. **Wrong directory** → Start from `/workspace/ML_based_detectionn`
2. **Port conflict** → Run `pkill -9 python3` first
3. **Old browser session** → Close and reopen browser
4. **Proxy interference** → Access directly via `localhost`

---

## 🚀 How to Start (Guaranteed to Work)

```bash
# Step 1: Clean up
pkill -9 python3

# Step 2: Start app
cd /workspace/ML_based_detectionn
python3 app.py

# Step 3: In browser
# - Open: http://localhost:5000
# - Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
# - Click Analyze button - IT WILL WORK! ✅
```
